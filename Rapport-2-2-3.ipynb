Introduction\n\nIn this report, we present the results that we obtained after analyzing the thermical behavior of a building. The aim of this exercice is to create a virtual model representing our building in order to run the thermical simulation with a simplified model. \n\nFirst, we are going to describe our building, its location, geometry, use and materials. We will then define the hypothesis used to make the simplified model. After that, we will define the conditions needed to run the model, such as the local weather, the internal sources (occupants, electronic devices, lightings) and the heating/ventilation system. \n\nIn a second part, we are going to draw the diagram that we will use to defined the terms of the different matrices needed to run the calculations. This diagram is supposed to schematize the thermical behaviour of the building. We will do it with different steps : each one will add a difficulty to the model, such as a heating and ventilation system and the orientation and the direction of the sun rays. We will also explain why we made different choices to modelise/discretise some materials compared to others. \n\nWe used a Matlab program to run the calculations, the code will be presented all along this report in order to be able to run it here directly.\n\nIn a last part, we will implemant the model in DesignBuilder in order to compare the results with our calculations from Matlab (Temperature differences between inside and outside, and power needed to maintain an acceptable temperature inside the building). We will also try to change some parameters in order to improve the building energy consumption, such as different heating system, changing the thickness of the materials or adding some solar protections.\n\n\n## 1.

It is a rectangular plan with a large glass wall (1,2 cm of argon between two 0,4 cm glasses) facing North and 3 insulated brick walls (22 cm of bricks, 18 cm of wood wool insulation and 10,5 cm of exterior brick cladding). There is also one wood door (5 cm) to the outside, one wood door (5 cm) in the partition wall and an other window with the same thickness than the glass wall. The partition wall is composed of plaster with no insulation (5,4 cm of air between two BA13). \nHere is the plan : \n\n<img src=\"PLAN_projet.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n\nWe are supposed, in a second part, to modelise our workspace on DesignBuilder in order to compare the results. The height of the ceiling is 2,5 m. \nHere is the 3D model obtained :\n\n<img src=\"Vue 3D.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"800\"/>\n\nWe considered the workspace to be on the ground floor, with sufficient insulation in order to consider there is no flow passing through the floor. We also consider that there is the same workspace on the 1st floor of the building, with the same caracteristics and inside temperature than ours, so there is also no flow between our workspace and the upper floor.\n\n### 1.3 Materials' properties and others needed values\n\n\nHere is the list of the different materials we chose to use in this project, with their thickness and caracteristics : \n\n\n| Material | Thickness (m) | Thermal conductivity (W/mK | Density (kg/m3) | Specific heat (J/(kg.K)) |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | \n| Structural brick wall | 0,22 | 1,310 | 1700 | 707 | \n| Cladding (bricks) | 0,105 | 1,310 | 1700 | 707 | \n| Wood wool insulation | 0,18 | 0,036 | 55 | 2100 | \n| Plaster | 0,013 | 0,35 | 950 | 1088 | \n| Glass | 0,004 | 1,05 | 2500 | 840 | \n| Argon | 0,012 | 0,018 | 1,378 | 520 | \n| Air | 0,054 | 0,024 | 1,225 | 1004 | \n| Wood door | 0,05 | 0,120 | 500 | 2301 |\n\n\n\nThe surfaces and volumes are given in the next tables : \n\n\n| Type of panel | Surface (m2) |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Total surface of office's wall | 23,20 |\n| Total surface of kitchen's wall | 15,40 |\n| Surface of glass wall in the office part | 15,95 |\n| Surface of glass wall in the kitchen part | 6,40 |\n| Surface of the window | 1,50 |\n| Surface of one door | 1,80 |\n| Surface of one plaster board | 8,20 |\n\n\n\n| Type of space | Volume (m3) |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Air of the office | 23,20 |\n| Air of the kitchen | 15,40 |\n\n\n\n\nThe coefficient convection are the following : \n\nho = 10 W/(m2.K) for the outside\n\nhi = 10 W/(m2.K) for the inside\n\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"592c7d71-2f5d-4735-8558-ecc85a50ade9"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"% width (m)\nw_brick_in = 0.22;\nw_brick_out = 0.105;\nw_insulation = 0.18;\nw_door = 0.05;\nw_plaster = 0.013;\nw_glass = 0.004;\nw_argon = 0.012;\nw_air = 0.054;\n\n% Surfaces (en m2)\nS_wall = 35.125;\nS_wall_office = 2.5*(4+0.5+1.1+2.9)+1.5+0.5*0.9;\nS_wall_kitchen = 2.5*(0.96+0.6+4)+1.5;\nS_glasswall_kitchen = 6.4;\nS_glasswall_office = 15.95;\nS_window = 1.5;\nS_door = 2*0.9;\nS_plaster = 8.2;\n\nV_air_kitchen = 2.5*10;\nV_air_office = 2.5*25;\n\n% Thermal conductivity (en W/mK)\nl_brick = 1.310;\nl_insulation = 0.036;\nl_glass = 1.050;\nl_wood =  0.120;\nl_plaster = 0.35;\nl_argon = 0.01772;\nl_air = 0.024;\n\n% specific heat (J/(kg.K))\ncp_brick = 707;\ncp_insulation = 2100;\ncp_wood = 2301;\ncp_glass = 840;\ncp_air = 1004;\ncp_argon = 520;\ncp_plaster = 1088;\n\n% density (kg/m3)\nd_brick = 1700;\nd_insulation = 55;\nd_wood = 500;\nd_plaster = 950;\nd_glass = 2500;\nd_air = 1.225; \nd_argon = 1.378;\n\n% convection coefficients[W/m2 K]\nho = 10;    hi = 4;\n\n%% Thermal capacity  (J/K)\nC_brick_in_kitchen = d_brick*cp_brick*w_brick_in*S_wall_kitchen;\nC_brick_out_kitchen = d_brick*cp_brick*w_brick_out*S_wall_kitchen;\nC_brick_in_office = d_brick*cp_brick*w_brick_in*S_wall_office;\nC_brick_out_office = d_brick*cp_brick*w_brick_out*S_wall_office;\nC_insulation_office = d_insulation*cp_insulation*w_insulation*S_wall_office;\nC_insulation_kitchen = d_insulation*cp_insulation*w_insulation*S_wall_kitchen;\nC_wood = d_wood*cp_wood*w_door*S_door;\nC_glass = d_glass*cp_glass*w_glass*S_window;\nC_glasswall_kitchen = d_glass*cp_glass*w_glass*S_glasswall_kitchen;\nC_glasswall_office = d_glass*cp_glass*w_glass*S_glasswall_office;\nC_plaster = d_plaster*cp_plaster*S_plaster*w_plaster;\nC_argon_glasswall_kitchen = d_argon*cp_argon*w_argon*S_glasswall_kitchen;\nC_argon_glasswall_office = d_argon*cp_argon*w_argon*S_glasswall_office;\nC_argon_window = d_argon*cp_argon*w_argon*S_window;\nC_air_plaster = d_air*cp_air*S_plaster*0.54;\n\nC_air_kitchen = d_air*cp_air*V_air_kitchen;\nC_air_office = d_air*cp_air*V_air_office;","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"692576b7-b462-4d42-ad6f-e4cf69d51902"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

There is no flow between the ground, the upper floor and our workspace.\n5. There is no conduction at the junction between walls and glass, because the variation is negligible.\n6. The density and the capacity of the air are identical in each room.\n7. The flow absorbed by the window is not neglected.\n8. We neglect reflected radiations.\n9.
